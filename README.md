## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css) - For styles

### Continued development

I will continue practicing flexbox and grid projects. These are very useful in setting up the layout of the website.

### Useful resources

- [CSS GRIDS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This are pretty useful while working with grids.
